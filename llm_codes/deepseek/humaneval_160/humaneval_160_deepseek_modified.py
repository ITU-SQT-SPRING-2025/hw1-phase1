# def do_algebra(operator, operand):
#     Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and
#     the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric
#     expression and return the evaluation of this expression.
#     The basic algebra operations:
#     Addition ( + )
#     Subtraction ( - )
#     Multiplication ( * )
#     Floor division ( // )
#     Exponentiation ( ** )
#     Example:
#     operator['+', '*', '-']
#     array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
#     result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
#     => result = 9
#     Note:
#         The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one. But you should do explicit checks and raise a ValueError if necessary.
#         You should check for operand correctness and raise ValueError if necessary.
#         Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
#         Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.
#         You should consider operator precedence as well. Operator precedence is:
#             Exponentiation ( ** ) > Multiplication ( * ) = Floor division ( // ) > Addition ( + ) = Subtraction ( - )
#             Same level operations are concluded from left to right.
