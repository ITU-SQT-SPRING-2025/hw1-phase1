#   "\ndef f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\"\"\n"
