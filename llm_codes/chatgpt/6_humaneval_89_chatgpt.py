    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated.
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places (i.e., 2 * 2 = 4).
    
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'

            shifted = (ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a')
            result += chr(shifted)
        else:
            result += char  # preserve non-alpha characters if needed

    return result

# Explanation:
# - We're rotating the alphabet by 4 positions (2 * 2).
# - The rotation wraps around using modulo 26.
# - Assumes lowercase letters only, as per your examples.
# Let me know if you want it to handle uppercase letters or preserve formatting/punctuation too!
