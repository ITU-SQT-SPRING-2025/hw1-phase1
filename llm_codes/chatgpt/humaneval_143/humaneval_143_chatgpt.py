    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,

    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
