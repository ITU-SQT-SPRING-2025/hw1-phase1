# Here's how you can implement the will_it_fly function based on the criteria described:

def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    An object will fly if:
    - It's balanced (palindromic list)
    - The sum of its elements is less than or equal to w
    '''
    return q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w

# Explanation:
# - q == q[::-1]: Checks if the list is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards).
# - sum(q) <= w: Ensures the total weight doesn't exceed the max allowable weight w.

# Example Usage:
# print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))       # False
# print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))    # False
# print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))    # True
# print(will_it_fly([3], 5))          # True

# Let me know if you want to add input validation or support for other types of elements.
