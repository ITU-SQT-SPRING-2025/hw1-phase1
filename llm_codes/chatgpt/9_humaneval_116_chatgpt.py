    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

    It must be implemented like this:
    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]

    """
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))

# Explanation:
# - bin(x).count('1'): Counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of x.
# - key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x): Sorts first by number of 1s, then by the value itself for tie-breaking.

# Notes:
# - This handles negative numbers correctly too since bin(-3) returns '-0b11', and count('1') still gives a meaningful count.
# - The logic doesn't restrict to non-negatives; it respects the ordering by ones and then by decimal value for all integers.
# Let me know if you want it to ignore negatives or handle them differently!
